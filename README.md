# Web Development Studies 🚀

This repository is a collection of my web development journey. I started from scratch and I'm documenting my progress through practical examples.

## 📂 What's Inside?
- **Real-world Examples:** Simple landing pages like the "Carpet Cleaning" project.
- **Form Structures:** Practical work on HTML forms and user inputs.
- **HTML Basics:** My first steps into the web world using semantic tags.

## 🛠 Tech Used
- **HTML5** (Current focus)
- **CSS3** (Next step)

## 🎯 My Goal
To build fully responsive and functional websites while learning the logic behind the code. Every file here represents a step forward in my learning process.
